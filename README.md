# Voltorb Flip

My solution to the NAND2Tetris assignment project #9.

Check out the NAND2Tetris website if you don't know what I am talking about. It's one of the greatest CS courses I know of, I highly recommend taking it.  [*click*](www.nand2tetris.org/)

I aimed at creating a game for the Hack-platform that is not only a good demonstration of its capabilities and limitations, but also a fun game to play. Be encouraged to try it for youself.

## How to run

You need a Jack VM emulator. You can get it from www.nand2tetris.org. There may be better, unofficial alternatives. Then download code by zipping or cloning it from this repo and open the `vm` sub-directory in it. Turn animations off and you're good to go. Press the play button.

## About the original VoltorbFlip

VoltorbFlip is a Pokémon minigame from HeartGold/SoulSilver (EU/US variants). You can learn everything about it here: [bulbapedia](bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Voltorb_Flip)

I am not associated with Nintendo, the Pokémon Company, Creatures Inc., GameFreak, or anyone else involved in or holding rights of the Pokémon brand.

## Notes

This code is not under any license. Feel free to do with it what you want, although it would be nice if you'd not sell it off as yours in your exercises.

Otherwise, feel free to contribute if you like. It's a fun little project.
